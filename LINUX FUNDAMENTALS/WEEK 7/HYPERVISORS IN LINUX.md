## HYPERVISORS IN LINUX

  Xen
  - Is at the top of hypervisors and is open-source much like Virtual box. Xen can also be purchased as a commercial version. It supports virtualization of x86, IA64, and ARM among other architectures.

  UCS Virtual Machine Manager
  - This specializes in working with cloud VMs, clusters, and other enterprise-level virtual systems. The software is free and open source, and though its primary target is the enterprise, average users can take advantage of it for things like Amazon Private cloud, etc.

  Gnome Boxes
  - Many people in the Linux community praise the tool for its quick setup wizard, ability to load up an OS image directly from a URL, and more. This application is quite useful, even for advanced Linux users with complex needs.

  OpenVZ
  - It is an enterprise approach that is an open-source container-based virtualization platform created for Linux. OpenVZ has the ability to create many virtual machines in a Linux container.

  SmartOS
  - It is an open source hypervisor based on the Unix operating system. SmartOS integrates OpenSolaris technology with Linuxâ€™s Kernel-based Virtual Machine Virtualization technology.

  Out of all these options Gnome box seems to be the best and most up to date. The service is free and opensource and claims to be very similar to virtual box and the systems that it uses. This would have to be the best alternative for a business environment that needs a reliable option for all there virtual workstations.
