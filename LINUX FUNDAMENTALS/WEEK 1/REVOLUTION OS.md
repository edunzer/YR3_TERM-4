  __QUESTION:__

    *What is Open Source?*
      `Open source is a way for people to collaborate on software without having the buying agreement or legal implications. Basically its "free" but also "free" in the sense that there are no businesses tied to it. No one claims it as there property. `

    *Who is Richard Stallman and what contributions did he provide to the open source community?*
      `He was the starter of free software movement. He created the definition of what open source really is and started the movement for creators to share information and code/programs to share. He was one of the first to start hacking and sharing those hacks with others.`

    *What is source code?*
      `Its the programming code behind the curtain of most programs and software's. This is what runs the program or software. Often times this is proprietary to the writer/business and wants to be protected by that writer/business. `

    *Describe BSD and provide an explanation of the projects that are still maintained today that were derived from the original BSD.*
      `BSD is basically a fully built and running OS where as Linux was really just a part of an operating system. BSD also brought in many elements that were great for the user like ports system, which allowed the installation of software packages. One of the biggest and still maintained BSD's is MAC OS X which uses the base level operating system and then they put there own code on top which is closed to the public. FreeBSD is also available and one of the most popular options. `

    *What prevents open source software from being copied, altered, and becoming closed source software?*
      `Open source software does have licensing agreements that can prevent there code from being copied and then to be sold. Often times there is a kind of agreement between open source content where if you want to alter it and make it better then feel free to do so, just don't forget where the main code came from. Linux for example was like this where the idea was to get people to use it and change it and offer there own versions of it. There are tons of different types of operating systems that are based on Linux but have there own name on them. They just fall under the main category of Linux. Linux's licensing system actually specifies that the source code has to be released in order for anyone to use it in there own project. `

    *How do businesses make money from open source software?*
      `They often provide support for the use of that software that they have given to you. This means that the user downloads the software and then the company that built that software gains money only from that user purchasing "help" or "support". This could be solving problems or user errors that are happening with there implementation etc. `

    *What was the application that launched Linux into the 'must-have' realm of operating systems?  What does this software do?*
      `The application called Apache webserver. This gave a reason for many businesses to look into the Linux system and how it was more cost effective. It allows you to host websites through a server/system. Apache took off because it had better functionality and allowed you to host more then one website on a single system. `

    *At the time, what software was the largest competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer?  What open source project did this turn in to?*
      `Netscape was the main competitor, but was being taking over because there software was payed for and internet explorer was being given away. So in response to that Netscape decided to make there software open source in order to surf off of the open source trend. They also changed the name to Mozilla, which is the end open source software that was released.  `

    *What is the difference between free software and open source software?*
      `Free software has an owner and is closed to the public as far as changes. The owner can change what ever they want and then that translates to the user. Open source has no owner but does have authors, meaning that whatever version you downloaded probably has multiple contributions if its open source and has been passed around and changed multiple times. `

    *What seemed to be the biggest issue with getting Linux out to multiple users? (Hint: hardware).  Has this issue been resolved, or, are solutions being developed?*
      `The largest problem was the software wasn't perfect with installation and use on all hardware. Often times in the beginning there were classes and groups that would actually be around to help figure out problems and installs on your personal hardware. Now days I would say its definitely better but the problems can still be around. For example some pieces of hardware are not completely compatible. `

    *Does the Red Hat initial public offering (IPO) outcome remind you of any other tech-related companies in recent time?  In other words, has history repeated itself?*
      `Well its very similar to Facebook levels of interest and excitement. Although it wasn't the same numbers it was the same type of release and interest in a new product. There was also this kind of interest in Microsoft when it was releasing and starting to gain traction. `

    *Explain the difference between UNIX and Linux.*
      `The UNIX systems were often an all in one machine. You needed the machine/hardware that was sold by the company to work with the UNIX operating systems. This made them very expensive and often only allowed large companies and schools to purchase them. No one could buy one for the home. Linux was the solution to this because it was able to run on any hardware and you could configure it differently. `
