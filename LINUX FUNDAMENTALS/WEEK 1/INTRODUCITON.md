## INTRODUCTION

`I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. This means that I will be going into the tech field; more specifically Web marketing, email marketing, and Web development. As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 3 years ago but am hoping to move back as soon as possible. You can probably guess that I like computers but I also like working on my car and cooking.

Right now my laptop is on the newest version of Ubunutu with a couple skins to make it look nice. I originally changed from windows to take some load off the small onboard cpu that it has, but now I'm starting to really like the environment. The only problem that I have is that linux doesn't like some Lenovo laptop wireless cards, so you have to install a patch in order for the wifi connection to work. Other then that it is doing a great job as my second pc, which really only displays my calendar, tweetdeck, and discord.

I look forward to this class and hope to gain a lot of new knowledge that I can use in a future career.`
