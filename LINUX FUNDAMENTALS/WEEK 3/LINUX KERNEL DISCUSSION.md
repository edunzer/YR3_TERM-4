## LINUX KERNEL DISCUSSION POST

  The 2 main features of the kernel are memory management, and process management. memory management keeps track of how much memory is used and what/where it is stored. process management determines which processes can use the CPU at certain times and for certain intervals.

  Greg Kroah-Hartman is responsible for maintaining the Linux kernel. Along with many others including Shuah Khan who is also a kernel developer and maintainer. The official Linux kernel developers push out stable kernel builds once bugs are brought to there attention and fixed. Many releases are pushed out and labeled "long term" stable versions of the kernel. Often the main kernel is taken by distributors and slightly modified to fit there distribution and work with all the extra programs.
