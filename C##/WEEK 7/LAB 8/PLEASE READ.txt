So I did complete the lab but I completely forgot about creating different classes to solve the truck vs car problem. Although this was the main part of the lab and you wanted me to create new ones to show how I can use them I did show that I understand class inheritance with the existing classes that were in the Lab. I reused the validator.cs along with changing all information in the vehicleDB.cs  with everything still working. I also added accouple new features that we havent talked about and some good error handeling when making choices in the frmAddvehicle.cs

I hope that you look through the code that Im giving you and concider what I have changed and what I have accomplished.
