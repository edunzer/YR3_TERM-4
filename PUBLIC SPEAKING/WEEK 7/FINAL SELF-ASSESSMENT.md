## FINAL SELF-ASSESSMENT

I'd like you to reflect on your experience in this course and briefly address each of the following:

  What did you find helpful, or not helpful, in this course with speech anxiety and/or apprehension?

  Do you feel that you have improved your public speaking skills since the beginning of the term? Why or Why Not?

  If you could design a public speaking course so that it was focused on the types of speaking experiences and environments most relevant to your field of study - what types of speeches or skills would you include?

  Do you think it would be beneficial to have a course, or include within a course, how to give presentations remotely? Why or why not.

  This course is one of the fully online courses that requires synchronous meeting times. Do you think it was helpful to have required meetings? IS there a more convenient way that the synchronous portions could be scheduled to better fit the busy live of online students?

  Anything else you want to add?
