## FINAL SELF-ASSESSMENT

I'd like you to reflect on your experience in this course and briefly address each of the following:

  What did you find helpful, or not helpful, in this course with speech anxiety and/or apprehension?
  - I think the best part and most helpful part of this class was simply getting me back into the swing of making speeches and preparing presentations. This really enabled me to get used to making presentations as the person I am right now. My last presentation being 4 plus years ago was when I wasn't as comfortable speaking and presenting in front of people.

  Do you feel that you have improved your public speaking skills since the beginning of the term? Why or Why Not?
  - Yes I definitely have. As I said above I hadn't really given a presentation in awhile so getting to present defiantly made me more comfortable in speaking to a "group".

  If you could design a public speaking course so that it was focused on the types of speaking experiences and environments most relevant to your field of study - what types of speeches or skills would you include?
  - Well I actually think that was accomplished in this course. Most of my speaking will most likely be to small groups, and very likely over video conference. Also there will be presentations that will be explaining data or problems. All my presentations were like this for that reason. The only thing that I think I need to practice more is just simple group communication. Often when I am in a group if someone isn't doing there work I just take over and don't give them and reason because the project needs to be completed.

  Do you think it would be beneficial to have a course, or include within a course, how to give presentations remotely? Why or why not.
  - I think this should be very specific to the degree. Most tech/business jobs have more remote opportunities then other careers so they should definitely have that environment, but other degrees might not have that high rate or remote jobs.

  This course is one of the fully online courses that requires synchronous meeting times. Do you think it was helpful to have required meetings? IS there a more convenient way that the synchronous portions could be scheduled to better fit the busy live of online students?
  - I think it made things easier to have set meeting times. Was defiantly nice to just sign up for all the times available and then plan for those days. I would of liked to have the meetings on a different day. Middle of the week kind of creates a weird time frame for me to prepare and also get other things done. Maybe have one meeting at the beginning of the week and at the end.

  Anything else you want to add?
  - Although I think this was a great introduction speaking course I do think the time limits should be more enforced along with form of presenting. I could imagine some people going way over time because there presentation was too loosely structured. But maybe I should just expect that from the higher level classes since this was more of a beginning course.
