I think the biggest problem I have with listening is that the types often have to overlap for me to actually pay attention. As stated in the power point there are 4 types, appreciative, empathic, comprehensive, and critical. Often times I have found that in order for me to pay attention and understand everything that is being said I have to be appreciative of the topic. For example I can learn extremely easily but that will only happen when I'm appreciative or being critical of the topic. Often times I can listen to someone speaking and actually answer questions that they give me in the moment but when I walk away everything is forgotten. This was a huge reason why in school I would never get good grade because half of the information that was on the tests was in lectures, now that I'm fully online this problem has gone away entirely and my grades have never been higher.
