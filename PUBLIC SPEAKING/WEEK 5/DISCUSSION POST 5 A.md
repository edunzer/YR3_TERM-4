## DISCUSSION POST 5 PART A

  *Explain denotative and connotative meaning.  Now, offer a word/phrase of your choice that has some meaning to you (it would be great if you can choose a word/phrase that you could see yourself using in one of your speeches for this class, but any word will work).  First, give the denotative definition of the meaning.  Then, give your connotative definition.  Think about how others might have a different connotative meaning.  How would you go about explaining you connotative meaning in a way that explains the term as it applies to you without offending others?*

    `Denotative meaning: Literal, or the dictionary meaning of word or phrase. They are citable definitions that usually appear in dictionary's or textbooks. Connotative meaning: Can be a signifying or suggestive words with a secondary meaning in addition to the primary meaning.`

    `As a denotative example the phrase 'The blueberry is very blue' can be used because its a factual statement in regards to the words blue. Then we have the connotative  example 'Fred is very blue' which is not factual but instead is only understood because 'blue' means sad to most people when describing a person.`
