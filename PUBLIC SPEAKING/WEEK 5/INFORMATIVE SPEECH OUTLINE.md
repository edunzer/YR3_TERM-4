## INFORMATIVE SPEECH OUTLINE (Climate change/solar energy)

  - Point 1: Most people think that we need to go full electric on all cars and energy creation in order to stop climate change but it terns out we don't. The only reason people think that is there not willing to build to anything to solve a problem. Instead we need to make one giant change in order to solve the problem.
