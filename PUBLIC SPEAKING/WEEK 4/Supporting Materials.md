This article is well researched with many sources itself, along with personal accounts. There is a single author that has had a long career with the NPR organization and also lives in France the country that is being talking about.

Although NPR does rely on sponsorship in order to pay the bills the organization it self is very trusted among the public and has no record of misinformation. Its also a .org which is highly regarded as a web address that only provides sound information.
