## DISCUSSION POST 6 PART B ORGANIZING A PERSUASIVE SPEECH

The visualization  step basically gives the audience the solution to the problem that was presented. This way the audience only sees the problem that was outlined in the 'need' portion of the speech and then sees the solution that is outlined in the 'visualization' part of the speech. This enables the presenter to control the situation and what the audience sees, and in the end win them over.

In order to effectively do this I think knowing your audience and knowing there opinion on the matter is a huge part of persuading them. If you don't cover certain doubts or aspects of the issue then your ability to convince them could not be as effective. So in order to do this you need to cover the issue to the fullest. This means covering ever aspect so that if someone as a incorrect understanding of the problem there will not be an issue.
