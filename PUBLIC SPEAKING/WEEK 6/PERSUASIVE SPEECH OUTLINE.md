## PERSUASIVE SPEECH OUTLINE

*IDEAS* `Schools should change required classes(computer fluency, home repair, basic communication, personal finance) to fit the time period`

Title of Speech: We need to change the education system, but we cant force everyone at once.

Step 1: Attention `About how school is getting more expensive and we aren't learning anything important.`
  1. A clear description of my narrative, story, example, statistic that I’ll be using.
    - There are several things that people always say about our schooling system. First its too expensive, second it doesn't help with your career, and there is no actual real world experiences that are learned. In my mind and many others all of these statements are true.
  2. Transition sentence from grabbing the audience’s attention to introducing the problem/need.
    - So in order to solve this issue lets cover all these problems and what it means to the students of the future.

Step 2: Need/Problem `Most kids out of high school and at the start of college don't know what they want to do.`
  1. Define and describe the need: What is the problem?
    - Over all the US school system is old; and like many other government agencies instead of foxing it the right way we are taking the long approach of slowly changing things one at a time. This means that not only are things happening very slowly but it is also trying to blend new ideas with old styles which never, ever works.
  2. Provide logical appeals(evidence) to support and define what the problem is.
    - This has been said by many people but also shown by the unskilled workforce that comes out of college with a four year degree that means nothing but the fact they spent thousands of dollars to say they can complete tasks.
  3. Discuss the logical ramifications of the problem as it applies to your audience’s everyday lives.
    - This is a common saying and is shown in the data and appeals of current workforce members. Often times instead of getting a job that the degree was suppose to "qualify" them for they have to start at the very beginning with low wages and work there way up.
  4. Provide emotional appeals to support the ramifications to people’s lives.
    - Despite this being a known issue it hasn't been solved, which for the current students and most recent students means that you are likely spending the most amount of money you have ever spent in order to get a degree that doesn't help you the way it should. Considering that jobs are getting harder to find for the average diploma having worker this isn't the best news.
  5. Briefly list some of the negative things that are a result of the problem or partially due to the problem.
    - Unemployment stats, income stats, comparison to EU trade school stats.  

Step 3: Satisfaction/Solution `About how degrees first need to change to fit the changing field, along with better information about the degree to help decision making. `
  1. What needs to happen to solve the problem? (this doesn’t necessarily have to be your specific solution yet)
    - Now in order to solve this problem there are several approach's that we can take.
  2. Describe your solution
    - The first option is to turn the normal bachelors degree into a trade school type degree. This would be achieved through learning more about the degrees potential career options and then changing the types of classes that would be needed so you can learn useful information for that career.
    - Second would be to change the idea of the typical 4 year college is like. This would be achieved by making the first year of any degree full of classes that would prepare students for life as an adult. Then after that first year you can pick your actual career and therefore the degree for the next 3 years of college.
  3. Provide logical appeals to support your solution
    - This would solve two main problems, the big one for most students is that they often change or want to change there degree path after the first year.
  4. Describe all the wonderful things about your solution
    - This will not only update the education system as far as college goes, but it could also change the over all appearance of some degrees.

Step 4: Visualization `How it will result in less uncertainty about your career, and you wont be wasting money on useless classes.`
  1. Illustrate the impact of the solution you’re are presenting. (Good time to show how your solution solves the list of problems you made under “Need”
    - Instead of showing that you have a bachelors some degrees will give you more skills to fulfil and standout to potential job opportunities. This will go along with the idea that college should prepare you more for adult life, whether that be in your career or just general living.
  2. Give a detailed description of what life would look like if people use your solution and then what life would look like if they didn’t use your solution
    -

Step 5: Action `Reevaluation of requirements for a career path. current degrees just cover what they think is the topic. this creates a lot of useless classes. `
  1. Tell the audience exactly what you want them to do
    - Well despite it being really nice if it all happened at once and every college started on this new trend it probably wont happen. Instead what will happen is that some college's, new one perhaps, will change there ways individually. This is often how school systems do implement change, through small changes at one school at a time. Often the change is made through an appeal from the schools leadership after someone has brought the need for a change to there attention. So in order for the public to hurry this process we need to bring these issues to the attention of school boards that want to change. Like I said this would often be newer schools or more progressive ones that pride themselves on change.
  2. Describe the amount of effort it will take (less effort = more likely to do what you ask)
    - Now much like any change this will take time, but with the help of the public showing there increased support for this issue the speed will increase. Much like recent events with change and reform the out cry of the public pushes for change. And although this will take time some of these changes wont require a huge amount of effort. New teachers might have to be found, and new degree plans developed but besides that its not like you have to create entirely new schools.
  3. Tell them when they will start seeing a difference (sooner = more likely to do what you ask)
    - Although I have felt that the schooling systems has been broken for a long time I have seen change through the years of being a student. Throughout lower education, elementary to middle school the change of using technology has happened relatively quickly. And because of this technology a lot of information has been given to the faculty members. Along with this I have personally seen the differences between multiple universities, community colleges, state schools, and technical institutes. Between those three different schools it is very apparent that state schools are the ones falling behind. Both community colleges and technical institutes are the ones that have changed more over time.
  4. I usually remind the audience of one of the benefits of choosing my solution.
    - Not only will this begin to solve a huge problem but it will certainly start the education on a path of change. The more and more we change the small schools and see the results the easier it will be to change the big ones.
  5. Repeat exactly what you want them to do.
    - “Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.” -Barack Obama
