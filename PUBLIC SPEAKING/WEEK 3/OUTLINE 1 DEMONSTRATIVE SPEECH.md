    *It’s good to know because*

      `This is a very simple dish to make and often is a great appetizer to make if you want to be fancy. `

    *I’m qualified to teach/show you how to ________________ because*

      `I have made this dish 3 times, and in 3 different ways. This allows me to choose which is best for your benefit. `

    *E.	PREVIEW your main points: [Ex: For this demonstration I will begin with what you'll need, how to prepare, and the general steps to complete this activity]*
