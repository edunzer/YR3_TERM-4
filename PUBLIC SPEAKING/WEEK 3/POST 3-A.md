## DISCUSSION POST 4 A VISUAL AIDS

  `For me personally I have always found visual aids to help in two important ways. First is to grab the attention and interest of the listener with some image. Often times it much more interesting to see something then hear it, and as a visual person my self I enjoy looking at something more then someone talking about it. Second thing is to clarify what is being said in the speech. Often times someone speaking may say something to quickly or not even cover it because they forgot and seeing it on screen will help amend this issue. Also seeing information on the screen is easier to learn and picture in your head and this will enable the listeners of the speech to learn more about the topic then what is just being said by the speech giver.`

  `As far as my career would go, visual presentations are a huge part of WEB marketing and marketing in general. Often times the people that are in charge of making decisions and changes don't see the data like many of the employees. So in order to combat this those lower employees need to present the data they have collected in a effective manor and convey whatever point that the data is showing.`
