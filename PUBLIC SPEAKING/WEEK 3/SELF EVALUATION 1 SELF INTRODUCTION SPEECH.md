## SELF EVALUATION 1 SELF INTRODUCTION SPEECH

  `I think the current assignment is fine, but there should be a couple more questions for students to answer. Simple ones like why are you at Oregon tech, where do you currently live, have lived. I think the current assignment is more focused on questions that would be answered in a later presentation, one that would require more thought about themselves.`

  `This introduction speech shouldn't be about something hard to think about like accomplishments, and instead it should just be about he person presenting it and what they are like. This way the student can get comfortable if need be with speaking, and also the teacher and possible other students can learn about each other.`

  `For example even though I had a plan for this original assignment I thought it was a little strange for a first speech so I put in some little bits of information about me to make it seem more personal. I found this to be much easier as a first speech because it became a simple conversation about who I am. And after listening to some other students I think it is important if you take this new approach to make it clear that there is a time limit and for them to organize there thoughts more.`
