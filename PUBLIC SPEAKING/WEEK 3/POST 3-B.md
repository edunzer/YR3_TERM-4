## DISCUSSION POST 3 B DEMO AND INFORMATIVE SPEAKING

  `From experience in my particular career informative presentations are often used more then formal ones. As I stated in the other post, marketing jobs often use presentations to convey information to other higher ups and although they are your boss the presentation needs to be quick and effective. This is where the informative speech comes in, where there is little to know fluff and rather just information for your boss to grasp and learn. This often has lots of data, graphs, and conclusions that you the presenter have come up with.`
