## INTRODUCTION SPEECH OUTLINE

  Hi my name is Ethan and I'm a junior at Oregon tech. I have just recently transferred to Oregon tech after a brief stay at OSU for 2 terms and 2 years at bend community college.

  I have lived in Oregon my entire life, the first 17 years in lake Oswego (Portland) and then 3 in bend.

  Although I moved to bend to get a new change of scenery I have figured out that I hate living here.

  The weather is either really hot or really cold, and the people don't know how to live in a city despite bend growing into one very quickly.

  Because of this I am looking to move back to Portland or as I call it "home" since bend has never felt that way.



  Other then that I like technology, cars, cooking and I plan on going into WEB marketing for my career.

  But lets cover some of my accomplishments instead.

  On the OSU entrance essay they wanted to know the same things as this speech was asking.

  What is your biggest accomplishment?

  In that essay I wrote about overcoming my reading disability and how it was hard and long work.

  But recently I have come to think this isn't something that I'm really "proud" of.

  I don't really see it as an accomplishment.

  I had lots of help and support along the way.

  So instead its just something that happened to me.



  This means I really had to think about what I had overcome and accomplished without help.

  And when I think about it I don't see all my academic accomplishments or typical accomplishments someone might list for this question.

  Instead I thought of something that I find is often overlooked in my age range.

  Matureness.

  Year after year of school I always found that my behavior was much more mature then my classmates; Which was ironic because I was an extremely shy person and had little social interaction.  

  But despite this small problem I learned to act as the adults that were around me.

  Instead of following the typical teenage path I was focused on learning skills and information about what it means to be a successful adult.



  This is the main difference I would describe between me and other 20 somethings.

  And this is what has enabled me to stand out in a working environment.



  Overall I think that this is the most important aspect of who I am as a person and what I am like.

  So despite my young exterior I have the mental age of someone much older.

  Unlike most 20 somethings I know how to frame houses, build with my two hands, repair cars, and also learn about problems in the world and talk about them in a respectful manor.

  This is what makes me who I am.

  Thank you.
