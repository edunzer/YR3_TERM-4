## INTRODUCTION SPEECH OUTLINE

  Hi my name is Ethan and I'm a junior at Oregon tech. I have just recently transferred to Oregon tech after a brief stay at OSU for 2 terms and 2 years at bend community college.

  I have lived in Oregon my entire life, the first 17 years in lake Oswego (Portland) and then 3 in bend. But right now I'm hoping to move back to the Portland area since bend isn't my favorite place to live.



  But lets cover some of my accomplishments.

  On the OSU entrance essay they wanted to know the same things as this speech was asking. what is your biggest accomplishment? in that essay I wrote about overcoming my reading disability and how it was hard and long work. But recently I have come to think this isn't something that I'm proud of and see as an accomplishment.

  I had lots of help and support. So instead its just something that happened to me.

  So I really had to think about what I have overcome and accomplished without help. And when I think about it I don't see all my academic accomplishments or typical ones someone might list.

  So what was I left with? well something that I find is often overlooked in the age range of someone between 15-25. matureness.

  year after year of school I always found that my behavior was much more developed then my classmates. which was ironic because I was an extremely shy person.
