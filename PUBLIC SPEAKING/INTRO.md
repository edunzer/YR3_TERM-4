## INTRODUCTION

`Hi,

I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. This means that I will be going into the tech field; more specifically Web marketing, email marketing, and Web development. I'm hoping this class will give me great tips and trick on how to communicate better in a conference environment. As many of you know more and more businesses are moving to remote working and tech has always been at the for front so although its likely I will have little to no speaking in person, phone calls and online conferences will be a daily thing. I hope to use what I will learn from this class in those conference environments and become great at on demand communication.`
